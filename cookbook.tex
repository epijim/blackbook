This cookbook is a collaborative work. The majority of the recipes come from Bill's recipe book, which he has collected over many years. Tina and I have added a few of our favourites, and tested out all the recipes in our own kitchen. All the photos are from our attempts at making the dishes. While Tina took the majority of the photos in this book, you'll have to forgive the less artistic pictures as they were probably my contributions.

Plum cake is originally a Bavarian dish, known as Zwetschgendatschi. It's spread throughout Germany, where is it often known as Pflaumenkuchen (literally, "plum cake"). While in Cambridge, Tina and I have made use of the orchards a few miles away from Cambridge at her old college of Girton. In days after a trip to the orchard, our diet switches to mainly plum cake as we eat our way through kilograms and kilograms of the fruit.

\smallskip
\emph{2 sachets yeast (each sachet has 7g)
\\500g flour
\\220g sugar\sidenote{Tina usually uses only 120g}
\\250ml milk
\\100g butter
\\2kg plums
}

\smallskip
Mix lukewarm milk with sugar and yeast. Leave for 10 minutes until you see bubbles. 
\\Mix butter, flour and salt together. Then add the milk-sugar-yearst mix.
\\Knead well until dough doesn't stick to your hands anymore.
\\Let the dough rise (approx. 20 mins in the oven at about 35 degrees).
\\Then roll dough out on a square tray. Place plums on top. 
\\Let it rise again (approx. 20 mins in the oven at about 50 degrees).
\\Then bake for 25 mins at 175 degrees.\sidenote{If the plums are sour, you can also add some more sugar on top before baking).}

\index{Hummus!beetroot}

I love hummus. This beetroot hummus is a nice twist. If you are motivated to make it extra creamy, you can peel the chick peas. To do this either pinch each check pea one by one, or, to speed things up just put them in a bowl with water and rub the chick peas together. The second method won't get all the skins, but it only takes a few minutes. The hummus also tastes better after sitting overnight in the fridge.

\begin{marginfigure}%

\smallskip
\emph{4 tbsp olive oil
\\1 tin chick peas
\\2 tablespoons tahini
\\2 cloves garlic
\\Large sprinkle toasted cumin seeds
\\4 small cooked beetroot\sidenote{
You can replace with almost anything! My favourite is half a block feta and 4 dates, roughly chopped.}
\\Salt and pepper to taste.
}

\smallskip
Put everything in a food processor.
\\Blitz it, adding water to get the looseness you want. 
\\Serve with sumac and cumin sprinkled on top.

\section{Masala pancakes}

\index{Vegetarian!potato pancakes}

A cheats Dosa. While it lacks the fermented taste and super crispy edges of real Dosa, this recipe is a super easy approximation of that South Indian dish. The potato filling and the batter are best made a bit ahead of time.

\begin{marginfigure}%
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{masalapancakes.png}
\end{marginfigure}

\smallskip
\emph{Olive oil, for frying
\\1 green chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
\\2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced
\\3cm piece of fresh root ginger, peeled and finely chopped
\\125g plain flour
\\1 large egg
\\275ml whole milk
\\1 tsp mustard seeds
\\1/2 onion, peeled and thinly sliced
\\1 tsp ground turmeric
\\4 to 6 cold, peeled boiled potatoes, roughly chopped
\\6 tbsp natural yoghurt
\\2 tbsp chopped coriander}

\smallskip
\newpart{For the potato filling:} 
\\Heat a little oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, add the mustard seeds and cook for 2 minutes until the seeds begin to pop. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until soft and golden brown. Stir in the turmeric and cooked potatoes and season, adding a dash of olive oil if necessary to aid frying. Fry over a medium heat for 4 minutes until softened and heated through. Leave to one side while you cook the pancakes.
\\\newpart{For the pancakes:} 
\\Toast the cumin seeds with a pinch of salt in a dry, medium- hot pan for about 1 minute until aromatic. Add a dash of oil and saute the chilli, garlic and ginger for a further 2 minutes until softened. Remove from the heat.
\\Put the spice/garlic mix into a bowl. Sift in the flour, season and make a well in the middle, then break in the egg and add half of the milk. Whisk the flour into the egg slowly until well incorporated, then gradually add the remaining milk. Continue whisking until the mixture is smooth and has the consistency of double cream. Whisk in 1 teaspoon of oil, then taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Leave the batter to rest for 10 minutes.
\\Heat a large, wide frying pan, then add a little oil. If the batter has thickened too much, add a tablespoon or two of milk. Pour in a ladleful of batter and tilt the pan to spread the batter out. Cook for a minute on one side until golden and crisp, then flip the pancake and continue to cook for a further minute until cooked through. Keep warm while repeating with the remaining batter.
\\\newpart{To serve:} 
\\Mix the yoghurt and coriander together and season to taste.
\\To serve, place a large spoonful of the potato filling in the middle of each pancake, adding a dollop of the yoghurt if you like, then roll up into a sausage shape.

\section{Kale lasagne}
\index{Vegetarian!kale lasagne}
\index{Kale!lasagne}

Kale stays crunchy, unlike spinach, which keeps the mix of textures in place. We sometimes make it with a meat sauce layer, like in the photo above.

\newpart{For the filling:} 

\emph{300g curly kale
\\30g butter
\\500g mushrooms, sliced
\\2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
\\A few sprigs of thyme, leaves only, chopped
\\175g lasagne sheets (fresh is best, but dried is fine)
\\20g Parmesan, grated
}

\newpage

\newpart{For the b\'echamel sauce:} 

\emph{750ml whole milk
\\1 bay leaf
\\1 onion, roughly chopped
\\1 celery stalk, roughly chopped
\\A few black peppercorns
\\50g unsalted butter
\\50g plain flour
\\2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
}

\smallskip
Preheat the oven to 180\celsius. Heat the milk for the béchamel sauce with the bay leaf, onion, celery and peppercorns until just below simmering. Remove from the heat and set aside to infuse. Roughly shred the kale or cavolo nero.

Put into a large saucepan and just cover with cold water. Add salt. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 2-3 minutes, until just tender. Drain well and set aside. Heat half the butter in a large, wide frying pan over a medium heat.

Add half the mushrooms and some salt and pepper. Increase the heat and fry, stirring often, for 5-10 minutes, until the liquid released by the mushrooms has evaporated and they are starting to reduce, concentrate and caramelise.

Stir in half the garlic and half the thyme, cook for a minute longer, then remove to a bowl. Repeat to cook the remaining mushrooms and set aside. Gently reheat the infused milk, then strain. Heat the butter for the b\'echamel sauce in a large saucepan. Stir in the flour to form a smooth roux and cook gently for a minute or two. Remove from the heat. Add about a quarter of the hot milk and beat vigorously until smooth.

Repeat with the remaining milk, adding it in 2 or 3 lots, until you have a smooth sauce. Return to the heat and cook for a few minutes, stirring often, allowing it to bubble gently until thickened. Stir in the mustard, then add some salt and pepper. Stir about half of the b\'echamel sauce into the kale; put to one side. Spread half the remaining b\'echamel over the bottom of a 28 x 22cm (or thereabouts) ovenproof dish.

Layer a third of the lasagne sheets in the dish, then spoon the kale over the top. Add another layer of lasagne, then the mushrooms. Finish with a final layer of pasta and the remaining b\'echamel. Scatter over the cheese and add a trickle of oil. Bake for about 30 minutes until golden. Serve straight away.

\\1 bulb garlic 
\\100g tomato pur\'ee
\\350g fresh white button mushrooms 
\\6-8 ripe tomatoes, halved  
\\2.5kg oxtail, jointed
\\2 tbsp plain flour 
\\1.7l of beef stock
\\Bouquet garni of thyme, bay and rosemary
\\15g unrefined sugar 
\\150ml red-wine vinegar}

\smallskip
\newpart{The day before:} 
\\Place the half the butter, a splash of oil, spices, orange zest, black pepper in with finely diced or sliced vegetables (except the mushrooms).
\\Take a casserole large enough to contain all the ingredients for the stew and place it over a medium flame.
\\ Cut the head of garlic in half, then add this, too (there's no need to bother peeling it or anything). Cook on medium heat for another 10 minutes, then stir in the tomato pur\'ee. Cook for a further five minutes, stirring all the time, then remove from the heat and set aside.
\\Finely slice the mushrooms and in another pan sauté them in 75g of butter until they have released all of their liquid and turned brown. Drain off the excess fat and add to the vegetable mix in the large pan.
\\Take a casserole or frying pan that is large enough to accommodate the tomatoes, flesh-side down, in one layer with a little more of the groundnut oil. Place the pan on medium heat and leave until the pan side of the tomatoes turns dark brown. Add one cup of the stock. Bring to the boil and reduce until a syrupy mush is left. The pan will need to be stirred while the stock is reducing. Scrape this mix into the pan with the other vegetables.
\\Pat the pieces of oxtail dry and toss them in the flour. Dust off any excess flour, then season generously. Heat a couple of tablespoons of groundnut oil in a large casserole. Add the oxtail and brown over high heat, turning regularly. Do this in several batches, to facilitate even browning. If necessary, change the oil in the pan so that the pieces of oxtail are not being browned in burned oil. Drain the browned pieces of oxtail on kitchen paper and add them to the pot of cooked ingredients.
\\Place the pan in which the meat was browned on high heat and, after a few minutes, pour in the port. Bring to the boil, the whole time scraping any meat residue off the bottom and sides of the pan, and as soon as the liquid boils, flame and reduce it by half. 
\\Add the spice parcel and the bouquet garni, and return to the boil. Reduce the heat and leave to simmer for five minutes. Remove from the heat and leave to cool.
\\Add this to the other pan containing the meat and vegetables, carefully combining the ingredients.
\\It is important that the meat is completely covered, so it might be necessary to add a little cold water.
\\Preheat the oven to 90\celsius. On the top of the stove, place the casserole on high heat and bring the liquid to the boil, making sure to scrape the bottom of the pan to stop the contents burning. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface, remove from the heat and lay a pierced piece of parchment paper on the surface of the liquid in the pan.
\\Place the pan in the oven for a minimum of seven hours, checking occasionally and topping up with water if the level of liquid has dropped too much. And I mean seven hours - this is the minimum time that should be set aside to cook the oxtail; longer will be even better.
\\Once cooked, remove the pan from the heat and allow to cool. When warm, carefully remove the pieces of oxtail with a slotted spoon and place them on a tray.
\\Return the pan to the heat for five to 10 minutes, and then pour into a smaller pan through a fine sieve. Reduce this liquid to somewhere between 300ml and 400ml, then remove from the heat and leave to cool a little before putting back the meat.
\\\newpart{The day before:} 
\\Cook the sugar in a small pan on high heat until it caramelises - on no account let it burn, so watch it carefully - then add the red-wine vinegar, stir, reduce to a syrup and add this to the reduced cooking liquid with the oxtail. Stir carefully to combine, then leave to stand for five to 10 minutes before serving. You may need to reduce the liquid to a sauce consistency

\section{Roast pork belly with apple and sweet potato mash}
\index{Mains!roast pork belly}
\index{Roast!pork belly}

This dish takes about three days - but it's actually a really easy, and impressive, main to make. This recipe is a slightly modified version of one by Peter Gordon (a kiwi chef). The pork is first marinated, then cooked. It can be served immediately after the first roasting, but if you're cooking it for a dinner party, it can be cooled, portioned into perfect rectangles, then reheated on the day.

\smallskip
\emph{2 kg boneless pork belly
\\50g (5 tbsp) five-spice
\\5 large carrots
\\3 granny-smith apples, peeled and diced
\\700g potatoes, peeled and diced
\\700g sweet potato, peeled and diced
\\50g butter
\\4 tbsp grain mustard
\\2 limes
\\3 tbsp capers, drained and chopped
\\Big bunch of coriander, chopped
}

\newpage

\smallskip
Score the rind and fat about 1cm apart, being careful to not cut all the way down into the meat. 
\\Mix the five-spice with an equal amount of salt and rub into the pork. Then place the pork in a tupperware so it's just submerged in water and leave for 24-48 hours in the fridge.
\\After the brining has finished, heat the oven to 190\celsius. Place a sheet of baking paper on a rimmed tray, and place the carrots, cut in half long-ways, on top. 
\\Place the pork on top of the carrots, skin side up. Pour 200ml of water on the tray, and roast the pork and carrots for 2 hours. 
\\After two hours, remove the pork and place in the fridge. Keep the fat and carrots as well. At this stage the pork can be kept for up to 4 days.
\\On the day you plan to eat, turn the oven to 190\celsius. 
\\To make the coriander mustard, simply mix lime juice, mustard, capers and coriander. Add a little oil if you want it smoother. 
\\To make the mash, take the fat and and add to a pan with the butter. When the butter starts to brown, add in the apples and carrots and cook with the lid on low till the apple turns to mush. 
\\While the apple cooks, boil the diced potato and sweet potatoes. Once the potatoes are ready, add the apple and mash. This mash can be made a bit early, and reheated when needed. 
\\About 40 minutes before you want to eat, fry the portioned belly pork in a pan with oil till the skin get's bubbly. Then flip the pork over, and put in the oven for 30 minutes.

\section{Bo Ssam}
\index{Pork!bo ssam}
\index{Mains!bo ssam}

This is a recipe for informal dinner parties: slow-roasted pork shoulder served with lettuce, rice and a raft of condiments. The recipe comes from  David Chang who runs the shrine to pork called  Momofuku in New York. This is a remarkably straightforward way to achieve high-level excellence with little more than ingredients and time. Simply cure the pork overnight beneath a shower of salt and some sugar, then roast it in a low oven until it collapses. Apply some brown sugar and a little more salt, then roast until it takes on the quality of glistening bark. Meanwhile, make the condiments; hot sauces and kimchi \& rice. Then tear meat off the bone and wrap it in lettuce, and keep at that until everything's gone.

\newpart{Pork butt (start the day before):}

\emph{1 whole bone-in pork butt or shoulder (3.5 to 4.5 kg)\sidenote{
You can either cut away the skin before cooking, or peel it off half way through. In the photo I peeled it off, but this leaves a much thicker layer of fat. Probably best to choose the method based on your cut.}
\\1 cup white sugar
\\1 cup plus 1 tbsp kosher salt\sidenote{
Kosher salt has a much larger grain than table salt, so half if not using kosher salt.}
\\7 tbsp brown sugar
}

\newpart{Ginger \& green onion sauce:}

\emph{2 1/2 cups whole green onions thinly sliced
\\1/2 cup minced ginger
\\1/4 cup neutral oil
\\2 tsp light soy sauce
\\1 tsp sherry vinegar
\\Salt to taste
}

\newpart{Ssam sauce:}

\emph{2 tbsp fermented bean-and-chili paste (ssamjang)
\\1 tbsp chilli paste (kochujang)
\\1/2 cup sherry vinegar
\\1/2 cup neutral oil
}

\newpart{Accompaniments:}

\emph{2 cups white rice
\\3 heads bendable lettuce
\\1 packet kimchi
\\1/2 cup neutral oil
}

\newpart{Pork:}
Place the pork in a large, shallow bowl. Mix the white sugar and 1 cup of the salt together in another bowl, then rub the mixture all over the meat. Cover it with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, or overnight.
When you're ready to cook, heat oven to 150\celsius. Remove pork from refrigerator and discard any juices. Place the pork in a roasting pan and set in the oven and cook for approximately 6 hours, or until it collapses, yielding easily to the tines of a fork. (After the first hour, baste hourly with pan juices.) At this point, you may remove the meat from the oven and allow it to rest for up to an hour.
When ready to serve, turn oven to 260\celsius. In a small bowl, stir together the remaining tablespoon of salt with the brown sugar. Rub this mixture all over the cooked pork. Place in oven for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, or until a dark caramel crust has developed on the meat. Serve hot, with the accompaniments.

\newpart{Accompaniments:}
For the green-onion and Ssam sauces - simply mix ingredients. 
Blend half the kimchi into a sauce, and serve the other half whole.
Prepare rice, wash lettuce and put kimchi and sauces into serving bowls.

\\2 large eggs, ready cracked
\\1 tbsp small dried shrimp
\\100g beansprouts
\\4 stalks Chinese chives, chopped
\\50g roasted peanuts, roughly chopped
\\Lime wedges, chilli flakes, fish sauce and sugar, to garnish}

\smallskip
Soak the rice sticks in cold water for about half an hour until pliable but al dente. Drain.
\\Meanwhile, make the sauce by combining the fish sauce, tamarind and palm sugar in a small pan. Heat gently to dissolve the sugar and taste. Add more of any of the ingredients as you wish. Season with chilli to taste. Set aside.
\\Lay out all the ingredients within easy reach of the hob in the order they'll be used. Put a wok on a high heat and add half the oil. Add the garlic, stir fry for a few seconds, then add the noodles and a splash of water. Stir fry until they're drying out, then add the sauce. Fry until they are almost soft enough to eat (they should be slightly chewy).
\\Push the noodles to the side of the wok and add the rest of the oil. Fry the tofu and prawns until the tofu is beginning to colour, then push to the side and add the eggs. Pierce the yolks and, when starting to set on the bottom, scramble.

\index{Meat curries!Lamb}

Nana's lamb/mutton marrow bone curry is one of my favourite dishes. In Sri Lanka mutton usually means goat, but lamb is often substituted in New Zealand. While this isn't Nana's recipe - it's still worth seeking out marrow bones for the curry.

Jaffna curry powder is dark roasted, and while optional, without it the curry has a very different taste.

\smallskip
\emph{3 tbsp ghee or butter
\\1 kg bone in lamb, diced
\\1 tin tomatoes
\\200ml stock
\\2 chillies, chopped
\\10 curry leaves, chopped
\\1 tbsp Jaffna curry powder (optional)
\\2 tbsp fennel, cinnamon, cumin, coriander, fenugreek, pepper, all ground, cardamon
\\5cm ginger
\\2 red onions, diced
\\10 cloves garlic
\\1 big bunch coriander}

\smallskip
Pre-heat oven to 170\celsius.
\\Put everything from the chillies, to the garlic in a food processor. Add half the coriander, then blend.
\\In an oven proof dish, fry the paste in the butter till it goes brown.
\\Add the tomatoes and the stock, cover in foil, and place in the oven for 1.5 hours.
\\Remove the foil and return to the stove.
\\Add the lamb, and cook for 1.5 hours, with the lid off for about half that time.

\section{Chicken curry (Scottish style)}
\index{Chicken!curry}
\index{Meat curries!Chicken}

Similar to a chicken tikka masala, a Glaswegian curry, but without the sweetness or food colouring.

\smallskip
\newpart{For curry:}
\\\emph{4 skinless chicken thighs or breasts
\\2 onions
\\Thumb-sized piece of fresh ginger
\\1/2 bunch fresh coriander
\\1 fresh red chilli
\\1/2 tin of chopped tomatoes
\\400g tin coconut cream
\\Handful of flaked almonds, to serve
\\1 lemon, to serve}
\\\newpart{For spice paste:}
\\\emph{2 cloves of garlic
\\Thumb-sized piece of fresh ginger
\\1 teaspoon cumin seeds
\\1 teaspoon coriander seeds
\\1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
\\1 teaspoon sugar
\\2 teaspoons garam masala
\\1/2 teaspoon sea salt
\\2 tablespoons groundnut oil
\\2 tablespoons tomato puree
\\Small bunch of fresh coriander
\\1/2 tablespoon desiccated coconut
\\2 tablespoons ground almonds}

\smallskip
To make the curry paste, halve, deseed and roughly chop the chillies, then peel the garlic and ginger. 
\\Put a frying pan over a medium-high heat and add the cumin and coriander seeds. Lightly toast for a few minutes, or until golden brown and smelling delicious, then remove from the heat. 
\\Add the toasted spices to a pestle and mortar and grind until fine, or put them in a food processor and whiz to a powder. 
\\Once you've ground them, add the toasted spices to a food processor along with the remaining paste ingredients and whiz to a smooth paste, then put to one side.
\\Slice the chicken lengthways into 2cm strips. 
\\On a clean chopping board, peel, halve and finely slice the onions. Peel and finely slice the ginger, then pick the coriander leaves and put to one side, finely chopping the stalks along with the chilli.
\\Place a large casserole pan over a medium-high heat and add a couple of lugs of oil. Once hot, add the onions, chilli, ginger and coriander stalks, then cook for around 10 minutes, or until softened and lightly golden. 
\\Add the chicken and roughly 140g of the tikka masala paste, stirring well so everything is nicely coated. Season with salt and pepper, add the tomatoes and coconut milk (save the rest for another day), then bring everything to the boil.
\\Turn the heat down to medium-low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes, then take the lid off and cook for further 5 minutes, or until the meat is tender and the sauce has reduced, stirring occasionally. 
\\Divide the curry between bowls, sprinkle over the almonds and coriander leaves. Serve with fluffy rice, a dollop of yoghurt and lemon wedges for squeezing over.

Apparently it's called "Raspberry Dream" in Germany. Really, it's an Eton Mess. The substitution of cream for the cheeses makes it taste a lot less creamy.

\\500g mascarpone (or instead: 250g sour cream and 250g soft cheese)
\\250g quark
\\vanilla essence 
}

\smallskip
Mix mascarpone, quark, and vanilla.
\\Break meringue in pieces (not too small).
\\Fill mascarpone mix, raspberries and meringue in a bowl in layers.
\\Leave for 3-4 hours in the fridge.
