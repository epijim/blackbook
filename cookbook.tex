\index{Brunch!burritos}

While the photo above is a Taco Bell double cheese and beef burrito, it summarises the point of breakfast burritos. They are an offensively American invention, that is a worthwhile extravagance that will sooth the morning after a big night out.

Cheesy eggs and tortillas are the only essentials here. It's also nice to add some starch, salsa and avocado. If you have the time, beans cooked with browned onions and minced chorizo, then lightly mashed makes an amazing refried beans.

\index{Brunch!Turkish eggs}

My favourite brunch dish is from \emph{Kopapa} in London, where I had the Turkish eggs one morning with Dad. Two poached eggs on a bed of garlicky yoghurt swimming in spiced melted butter. Amazingly good with some good crusty bread for dipping. The recipe is for one. 

\smallskip
\emph{2 eggs
\\1/2 cup greek yogurt
\\1 clove garlic, minced
\\1 tsp paprika
\\1/2 tbsp butter
\\Dried mint flakes
\\Optional: Fresh or dried chilli
}

\smallskip
Start poaching the eggs.
\\Melt the butter in a pan with the paprika, when it foams or browns, take off the heat. Season with salt and pepper. If adding chillies, add them to this butter mix.
\\Whip the minced garlic into the yogurt. Season.
\\Once the eggs are poached, place on top of the yoghurt in a bowl.
\\Pour the butter on top, serve with bread.

\newpart{For the rice:}
\\\emph{120g rice
\\600ml stock
\\2 eggs
\\1 onion sliced
\\3 cloves garlic
\\1 tbsp English curry powder

\smallskip
Get 600ml of stock to the boil, then add the eggs and set the timer to soft boiled (take eggs out of the stock when they are cooked).
\\In another pan, fry the onion with the curry powder, tumeric and a little oil. After a few minutes, add the garlic.
\\Once the onion is starting to brown, add the rice and stir. As soon as it's mixed, add in the stock. 
\\Keep the rice on medium high and occasionally stir. You might need to add a little water.
\\Once the rice is cooked, add in the seafood and butter. Season after tasting, as the fish might be salty. Serve with lemon wedges and sprinkle coriander on as garnish.
\\Mix the yoghurt, lemon rind and coriander. Serve with rice.

\index{Brunch!crisp omelette}

This recipe is from Ferrian Adria's \emph{"kitchen meal"} cookbook. The recipe is for two as a light meal. Strange to see chips in a Michelin starred chefs cookbook.. but it actually works.

\smallskip

\\6 eggs
\\70g salted potato chips
}

\smallskip
Break the eggs into a bowl and whip till frothy.
\\Add the chips and lightly mix, then leave for one minute.

A super easy summer dish. Can also be eaten for dinner. The asparagus and mushrooms can be cooked earlier, and then lightly reheated. 

\smallskip
\emph{2 tbsp olive oil
\\4 eggs
\\4 portobello mushrooms
\\2 handfuls asparagus
\\2 tbsp butter
\\1 clove minced garlic
\\1 anchovy fillet minced

\\Add in enough flour to make it a pliable dough but without making it too dry. The type of potato will affect this. 
\\Turn out onto a floured surface and roll until about quarter of an inch thick. Cut into six inch circles and then into quarters. 
\\Prick all over with a fork and cook in a heavy pan which has been lightly greased with butter. 
\\Cook each side for about three minutes or until golden brown.

\end{marginfigure}

Plum cake is originally a Bavarian dish, known as Zwetschgendatschi. It's spread throughout Germany, where it is often known as Pflaumenkuchen (literally, "plum cake"). 

While in Cambridge, Tina and I made use of the Girton orchards a few miles away from Cambridge. There we could help ourselves to all the plums and apples we could carry. In days after a trip to the orchard, our diet switched to mainly plum cake as we ate our way through kilograms of the fruit.

\smallskip
\emph{2 sachets yeast (each sachet has 7g)
\\500g flour
\\220g sugar\sidenote{Tina usually uses only 120g}
\\250ml milk
\\100g butter
\\2kg plums
}

\smallskip
Mix lukewarm milk with sugar and yeast. Leave for 10 minutes until you see bubbles. 
\\Mix butter, flour and salt together. Then add the milk-sugar-yeast mix.
\\Knead well until dough doesn't stick to your hands anymore.
\\Let the dough rise (approx. 20 mins in the oven at about 35 degrees).
\\Then roll dough out on a square tray. Place plums on top. 
\\Let it rise again (approx. 20 mins in the oven at about 50 degrees).
\\Then bake for 25 mins at 175 degrees.\sidenote{If the plums are sour, you can also add some more sugar on top before baking).}

\index{Starters!beetroot hummus}
\index{Vegetarian!beetroot hummus}
\index{Hummus!beetroot}

I love hummus. This beetroot hummus is a nice twist. If you are motivated to make it extra creamy, you can peel the chick peas. To do this either pinch each check pea one by one, or, to speed things up just put them in a bowl with water and rub the chick peas together. The second method won't get all the skins, but it only takes a few minutes. The hummus also tastes better after sitting overnight in the fridge.

\begin{marginfigure}%
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{beetroothummus.png}
\end{marginfigure}

\smallskip
\emph{4 tbsp olive oil
\\1 tin chick peas
\\2 tablespoons tahini
\\2 cloves garlic
\\Large sprinkle toasted cumin seeds
\\4 small cooked beetroot\sidenote{
You can replace with almost anything! My favourite is half a block feta and 4 dates, roughly chopped.}
\\Salt and pepper to taste.
}

\smallskip
Put everything in a food processor.
\\Blitz it, adding water to get the looseness you want. 
\\Serve with sumac and cumin sprinkled on top.

\index{Vegetarian!potato pancakes}

A cheats Dosa. While it lacks the fermented taste and super crispy edges of real Dosa, this recipe is a super easy approximation of that South Indian dish. The potato filling and the batter are best made a bit ahead of time.

\begin{marginfigure}%
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{masalapancakes.png}
\end{marginfigure}

\smallskip
\emph{Olive oil, for frying
\\1 green chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
\\2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced
\\3cm piece of fresh root ginger, peeled and finely chopped
\\125g plain flour
\\1 large egg
\\275ml whole milk
\\1 tsp mustard seeds
\\1/2 onion, peeled and thinly sliced
\\1 tsp ground turmeric
\\4 to 6 cold, peeled boiled potatoes, roughly chopped
\\6 tbsp natural yoghurt
\\2 tbsp chopped coriander}

\smallskip
\newpart{For the potato filling:} 
\\Heat a little oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, add the mustard seeds and cook for 2 minutes until the seeds begin to pop. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until soft and golden brown. Stir in the turmeric and cooked potatoes and season, adding a dash of olive oil if necessary to aid frying. Fry over a medium heat for 4 minutes until softened and heated through. Leave to one side while you cook the pancakes.
\\\newpart{For the pancakes:} 
\\Toast the cumin seeds with a pinch of salt in a dry, medium- hot pan for about 1 minute until aromatic. Add a dash of oil and saute the chilli, garlic and ginger for a further 2 minutes until softened. Remove from the heat.
\\Put the spice/garlic mix into a bowl. Sift in the flour, season and make a well in the middle, then break in the egg and add half of the milk. Whisk the flour into the egg slowly until well incorporated, then gradually add the remaining milk. Continue whisking until the mixture is smooth and has the consistency of double cream. Whisk in 1 teaspoon of oil, then taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Leave the batter to rest for 10 minutes.
\\Heat a large, wide frying pan, then add a little oil. If the batter has thickened too much, add a tablespoon or two of milk. Pour in a ladleful of batter and tilt the pan to spread the batter out. Cook for a minute on one side until golden and crisp, then flip the pancake and continue to cook for a further minute until cooked through. Keep warm while repeating with the remaining batter.
\\\newpart{To serve:} 
\\Mix the yoghurt and coriander together and season to taste.
\\To serve, place a large spoonful of the potato filling in the middle of each pancake, adding a dollop of the yoghurt if you like, then roll up into a sausage shape.

\index{Vegetarian!potato and leek soup}

This recipe for the French soup Vichyssoise is from Ferrian Adria's \emph{"kitchen meal"} cookbook. The recipe is for six as a starter. This dish is usually served cold.

\smallskip
\emph{200g potatoes
\\1 red onion
\\2 leeks
\\100g butter
\\1 litre chicken stock
\\6 eggs
\\240ml whipping cream
\\4tbsp croutons
\\Extra virgin olive oil, to drizzle}

\smallskip
Dice the potatoes into small pieces and keep in a bowl of water, so it doesn't brown.
\\Thinly slice the onion and leeks. 
\\Melt the butter on a medium heat and cook the leeks and onions for five minutes till soft.
\\Add the potatoes and the stock and simmer covered for 30 minutes.
\\Blend the soup till smooth, then pass through a sieve and place in the fridge till cold.
\\Soft boil the eggs (3 minutes in boiling water) then peel and place in the centre of a bowl. Pour the chilled soup around the egg, and drizzle on croutons and olive oil to serve.

A little slice of 1980's heaven. 

\smallskip
\emph{One camembert
\\1 clove of garlic
\\3 sprigs of rosemary}

\smallskip
Preheat the oven to 180\celsius. Leaving it in the box, score around the top of a 250g Camembert about 0.5 cm in. Finely slice a peeled garlic clove and poke it into the top of the cheese with a few fresh rosemary tips. Drizzle with a little olive oil then bake in the hot oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until gorgeous and oozy in the middle. 
\\Serve with toasted bread and a chutney or cranberry sauce.

\section{Focaccia}
\index{Sharing!focaccia}
\index{Starters!focaccia}
\index{Bread!focaccia}

A dish tiny and I really enjoyed while touring around northern Italy. 

\smallskip
\emph{500g flour
\\2tsp salt
\\2 sachets yeast
\\300ml water
\\2tbsp olive oil
\\Thyme or rosemary for the dough
\\Topping of choice\sidenote{I like halved olives and halved cherry tomatoes}
\\More olive oil to drizzle}

\smallskip
Mix the water, salt, yeast and olive oil in a standing mixer. The dough will be a bit sticky, so it's easier to knead with the machine. If you want herbs in the dough, add them now. Then leave for around 1-2 hours to rise. 

After it has doubled, put the dough on to a tray and spread out. Then use your fingers to push in dimples. Then place a halved tomato, or olive, into each dimple (or whatever else you want on the bread), then drizzle with olive oil. Leave to proof for 1-2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 200\celsius. Then place in the oven for around 20 minutes. Serve hot or warm.

\index{Kale!lasagne}

Kale stays crunchy, unlike spinach, which keeps the mix of textures in place. We sometimes make it with a meat sauce layer, like in the photo above.

\newpart{For the filling:} 

\emph{300g curly kale
\\30g butter
\\500g mushrooms, sliced
\\2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
\\A few sprigs of thyme, leaves only, chopped
\\175g lasagne sheets (fresh is best, but dried is fine)
\\20g Parmesan, grated
}

\newpage

\newpart{For the b\'echamel sauce:} 

\emph{750ml whole milk
\\1 bay leaf
\\1 onion, roughly chopped
\\1 celery stalk, roughly chopped
\\A few black peppercorns
\\50g unsalted butter
\\50g plain flour
\\2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
}

\smallskip
Preheat the oven to 180\celsius. Heat the milk for the b\'echamel sauce with the bay leaf, onion, celery and peppercorns until just below simmering. Remove from the heat and set aside to infuse. Roughly shred the kale or cavolo nero.

Put into a large saucepan and just cover with cold water. Add salt. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 2-3 minutes, until just tender. Drain well and set aside. Heat half the butter in a large, wide frying pan over a medium heat.

Add half the mushrooms and some salt and pepper. Increase the heat and fry, stirring often, for 5-10 minutes, until the liquid released by the mushrooms has evaporated and they are starting to reduce, concentrate and caramelise.

Stir in half the garlic and half the thyme, cook for a minute longer, then remove to a bowl. Repeat to cook the remaining mushrooms and set aside. Gently reheat the infused milk, then strain. Heat the butter for the b\'echamel sauce in a large saucepan. Stir in the flour to form a smooth roux and cook gently for a minute or two. Remove from the heat. Add about a quarter of the hot milk and beat vigorously until smooth.

Repeat with the remaining milk, adding it in 2 or 3 lots, until you have a smooth sauce. Return to the heat and cook for a few minutes, stirring often, allowing it to bubble gently until thickened. Stir in the mustard, then add some salt and pepper. Stir about half of the b\'echamel sauce into the kale; put to one side. Spread half the remaining b\'echamel over the bottom of a 28 x 22cm (or thereabouts) ovenproof dish.

Layer a third of the lasagne sheets in the dish, then spoon the kale over the top. Add another layer of lasagne, then the mushrooms. Finish with a final layer of pasta and the remaining b\'echamel. Scatter over the cheese and add a trickle of oil. Bake for about 30 minutes until golden. Serve straight away.

\section{Cheese fondue}
\index{Cheese!fondue}
\index{Fondue!cheese}

Fondue is a Swiss dish of melted cheese served in caquelon, sitting on a r\'echaud, and eaten by dipping bread into the cheese using long-stemmed forks. It became the national dish from the 1930s, when it was promoted to this title by the Swiss Cheese Union (Schweizerische K\"aseunion).

The cheese sauce is usually made up of 2 or more types of cheese. An aged Gruy\'ere (at least 8 to 12 months) is usually one of them, since it has such a great flavour. Two popular cheeses to pair with Gruy\'ere are Emmental, the stereotypical 'Swiss cheese' with the big holes, and Appenzeller. Vacherin fribourgeois is also good, and super creamy.

Traditionally it's served just with cubes of bread, but Tina and I like to also add steamed vegetables.

Tossing the cheese with cornstarch helps make sure the mixture forms an emulsion easily. I also tried it with a tiny bit xantham gum instead, which helps to stabilise the sauce while keeping the texture more like melted cheese, rather than a very cheesy mornay sauce (which happens if you add too much flour).

\emph{800g of cheese (mix of two), grated and tossed with a little cornstarch
\\350 ml of sour/dry white wine
\\2 cloves of garlic
\\Large shot kirsch
\\Pinch nutmeg
\\Pinch paprika
\\1 loaf of bread
\\A mixture of vegetables\sidenote{We like broccoli, cauliflower, radishes and romanesco}
}

Slice the garlic cloves in half then rub all over the inside of the caquelon. Then, finely dice the cloves and chuck them back in the pot.
\\Add the wine, and heat the coquelon till the wine starts to simmer.
\\As soon is it's bubbling, add the cheese and keep mixing till it forms a smooth mixture. 

Add a little more wine if it's clumpy, then once it's smooth add the shot of kirch and the nutmeg, and mix. \

Then, sprinkle on paprika and serve (don't mix in the paprika).

\emph{Le coup du milieu} can be loosely translated as "shot (or hit) at the halfway point". In the context of fondue, le coup du milieu is a small glass of spirits, usually kirsch, that is drunk about halfway through the meal and is supposed to aid digestion and stimulate a faltering appetite.

At the end of the meal, if you've been stirring away as you eat and the fondue has been kept at a very low bubble, you should find a crusty, golden, unburnt layer of cheese forming at the bottom of the pot, known as \emph{la religieuse (the nun)}. When all of the cheese has solidified into this cracker-like crust, extinguish the flame of the burner, use a knife to pry off the crust, lift it out and share it with your dining companions.

\emph{2L beef stock
\\50g butter
\\1 onion, finely diced
\\400g risotto rice\sidenote{Carnolo is best, than arberio}
\\300g red wine\sidenote{Barolo wine is traditional, but any works}
\\100g blue cheese\sidenote{Castelmagno cheese is a hard blue, but a mild creamy blue works as well}
\\Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper, to season
}

Heat the stock.

Fry the onion in the butter. Once softened, add the rice and toast for a few minutes.

Once the rice is mixed with the onion and butter, pour in the wine. Stir until the rice is dry, then continue to make like a normal risotto.\sidenote{Spooning in the stock, stirring till dry, then repeat}.

When finished cooking (around 20mins), add the cheese and mix. Then plate the risotto, making a little indentation in the top. Then pour the red wine, before topping with parmesen.

\section{Roast pork belly with apple and sweet potato mash}
\index{Mains!roast pork belly}
\index{Roast!pork belly}

This dish takes about three days - but it's actually a really easy, and impressive, main to make. This recipe is a slightly modified version of one by Peter Gordon (a kiwi chef). The pork is first marinated, then cooked. It can be served immediately after the first roasting, but if you're cooking it for a dinner party, it can be cooled, portioned into perfect rectangles, then reheated on the day.

\smallskip
\emph{2 kg boneless pork belly
\\50g (5 tbsp) five-spice
\\5 large carrots
\\3 granny-smith apples, peeled and diced
\\700g potatoes, peeled and diced
\\700g sweet potato, peeled and diced
\\50g butter
\\4 tbsp grain mustard
\\2 limes
\\3 tbsp capers, drained and chopped
\\Big bunch of coriander, chopped
}

\newpage

\smallskip
Score the rind and fat about 1cm apart, being careful to not cut all the way down into the meat. 
\\Mix the five-spice with an equal amount of salt and rub into the pork. Then place the pork in a tupperware so it's just submerged in water and leave for 24-48 hours in the fridge.
\\After the brining has finished, heat the oven to 190\celsius. Place a sheet of baking paper on a rimmed tray, and place the carrots, cut in half long-ways, on top. 
\\Place the pork on top of the carrots, skin side up. Pour 200ml of water on the tray, and roast the pork and carrots for 2 hours. 
\\After two hours, remove the pork and place in the fridge. Keep the fat and carrots as well. At this stage the pork can be kept for up to 4 days.
\\On the day you plan to eat, turn the oven to 190\celsius. 
\\To make the coriander mustard, simply mix lime juice, mustard, capers and coriander. Add a little oil if you want it smoother. 
\\To make the mash, take the fat and and add to a pan with the butter. When the butter starts to brown, add in the apples and carrots and cook with the lid on low till the apple turns to mush. 
\\While the apple cooks, boil the diced potato and sweet potatoes. Once the potatoes are ready, add the apple and mash. This mash can be made a bit early, and reheated when needed. 
\\About 40 minutes before you want to eat, fry the portioned belly pork in a pan with oil till the skin get's bubbly. Then flip the pork over, and put in the oven for 30 minutes.

\section{Bo Ssam}
\index{Pork!bo ssam}
\index{Mains!bo ssam}

This is a recipe for informal dinner parties: slow-roasted pork shoulder served with lettuce, rice and a raft of condiments. The recipe comes from  David Chang who runs the shrine to pork called  Momofuku in New York. This is a remarkably straightforward way to achieve high-level excellence with little more than ingredients and time. Simply cure the pork overnight beneath a shower of salt and some sugar, then roast it in a low oven until it collapses. Apply some brown sugar and a little more salt, then roast until it takes on the quality of glistening bark. Meanwhile, make the condiments; hot sauces and kimchi \& rice. Then tear meat off the bone and wrap it in lettuce, and keep at that until everything's gone.

\newpart{Pork butt (start the day before):}

\emph{1 whole bone-in pork butt or shoulder (3.5 to 4.5 kg)\sidenote{
You can either cut away the skin before cooking, or peel it off half way through. In the photo I peeled it off, but this leaves a much thicker layer of fat. Probably best to choose the method based on your cut.}
\\1 cup white sugar
\\1 cup plus 1 tbsp kosher salt\sidenote{
Kosher salt has a much larger grain than table salt, so half if not using kosher salt.}
\\7 tbsp brown sugar
}

\newpart{Ginger \& green onion sauce:}

\emph{2 1/2 cups whole green onions thinly sliced
\\1/2 cup minced ginger
\\1/4 cup neutral oil
\\2 tsp light soy sauce
\\1 tsp sherry vinegar
\\Salt to taste
}

\newpart{Ssam sauce:}

\emph{2 tbsp fermented bean-and-chili paste (ssamjang)
\\1 tbsp chilli paste (kochujang)
\\1/2 cup sherry vinegar
\\1/2 cup neutral oil
}

\newpart{Accompaniments:}

\emph{2 cups white rice
\\3 heads bendable lettuce
\\1 packet kimchi
\\1/2 cup neutral oil
}

\newpart{Pork:}
Place the pork in a large, shallow bowl. Mix the white sugar and 1 cup of the salt together in another bowl, then rub the mixture all over the meat. Cover it with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, or overnight.
When you're ready to cook, heat oven to 150\celsius. Remove pork from refrigerator and discard any juices. Place the pork in a roasting pan and set in the oven and cook for approximately 6 hours, or until it collapses, yielding easily to the tines of a fork. (After the first hour, baste hourly with pan juices.) At this point, you may remove the meat from the oven and allow it to rest for up to an hour.
When ready to serve, turn oven to 260\celsius. In a small bowl, stir together the remaining tablespoon of salt with the brown sugar. Rub this mixture all over the cooked pork. Place in oven for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, or until a dark caramel crust has developed on the meat. Serve hot, with the accompaniments.

\newpart{Accompaniments:}
For the green-onion and Ssam sauces - simply mix ingredients. 
Blend half the kimchi into a sauce, and serve the other half whole.
Prepare rice, wash lettuce and put kimchi and sauces into serving bowls.

\\2 good quality raw sausages.

Debone and skin the chicken, you want it to be around 1-2cm thick. 
Lay out some gladwrap, then place the three pats of butter on it, and season it with salt, pepper and pinches of either paprika or saffron. Then lay the chicken on top.  
Then mix the sausage with the pistachios and lay it like it is in the picture in the sidebar. Then, roll up tightly with lots of gladwrap, and, it you don't trust your wrapping, also place in a freezer bag.
When you're ready to cook, place the chicken roll into the sous vide machine at 60\celsius   for 2-3 hours. Anytime after two hours, slice to serve.

\newpart{Optional accompaniments:}
I roasted the bones to make a gravy, and also placed the skins between two baking sheets (between layers of wax paper), in an oven at 190\celsius  for 50 minutes to make chicken skin crackling.

Boil the tomatoes for 10 seconds then skin and deseed.
\\Heat the oil in a large frying pan to medium and fry the chicken skin side down till dark brown with the chorizo.
\\Remove the chicken and add chorizo.\sidenote{I like to blend 1/3 of the chorizo so it melts into the paella, but that's completely optional and probably heresy.}
\\Soon after, add the peppers and garlic and fry for 3 minutes.
\\Add the spices and rice.
\\After a few minutes, once the rice starts to go clear, add the stock and tomatoes and bring to the boil.\sidenote{If you deheaded the shrimp, I like to add it to the stock while it's heating (discard before adding to the paella).}
\\Turn the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes with the lid off.
\\Then add back the chicken, with the prawns and peas, and cook for 15 more minutes.\sidenote{If the prawns are large, turn them once by hand to make sure they cook through.}
\\Squeeze over a lemon and sprinkle with zest and juice.

\section{Phat thai}

\index{Noodles!phat thai}

Phat thai and I have a weird relationship. Like how hollandaise becomes less appealing when you make it yourself (and see all the butter) - I can't seem to make good phat thai without a lot of oil. It's still a great, and easy dish to make - it just needs a lot of ingredients.

\smallskip
\emph{120g 2-3mm wide flat rice sticks
\\60ml fish sauce
\\60ml tamarind water
\\60g palm sugar
\\Pinch of chilli powder, to taste
\\80ml groundnut or vegetable oil
\\2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
\\100g extra-firm tofu, chopped into small cubes
\\8 large prawns
\\2 large eggs, ready cracked
\\1 tbsp small dried shrimp
\\100g beansprouts
\\4 stalks Chinese chives, chopped
\\50g roasted peanuts, roughly chopped
\\Lime wedges, chilli flakes, fish sauce and sugar, to garnish}

\smallskip
Soak the rice sticks in cold water for about half an hour until pliable but al dente. Drain.
\\Meanwhile, make the sauce by combining the fish sauce, tamarind and palm sugar in a small pan. Heat gently to dissolve the sugar and taste. Add more of any of the ingredients as you wish. Season with chilli to taste. Set aside.
\\Lay out all the ingredients within easy reach of the hob in the order they'll be used. Put a wok on a high heat and add half the oil. Add the garlic, stir fry for a few seconds, then add the noodles and a splash of water. Stir fry until they're drying out, then add the sauce. Fry until they are almost soft enough to eat (they should be slightly chewy).
\\Push the noodles to the side of the wok and add the rest of the oil. Fry the tofu and prawns until the tofu is beginning to colour, then push to the side and add the eggs. Pierce the yolks and, when starting to set on the bottom, scramble.
\\Stir through the noodles, and add the radish, dried shrimp, beansprouts, chives and peanuts. Stir fry until well combined, then serve with the garnishes for people to add as they wish.

Nana was known for creating the three greatest dishes in the culinary world (marrow bone mutton curry, Nana's rolls \& Nana's brinjol). The original eggplant dish required the vegetable to be fried. If you fry - the dish will be incredible, but it will soak up at least 250mls of oil. Hence the slightly more waistline friendly recipe below.

\smallskip
\emph{3-4 Brinjal (eggplant)
\\1 tbsp mustard seeds
\\a few heavy splashes of oil
\\3 onions, diced or sliced
\\1 tsp salt
\\1 chillies, finely diced
\\2 tsp tumeric
\\1 stem curry leaves
\\1 tin coconut milk}

\smallskip
Preheat the oven to 200\celsius 
\\Dice the brinjal and pour over the oil. Tip into an overproof tray and cook for 40 minutes, or till brown.
\\In a fry pan, fry the mustard seeds in a little oil.
\\Once the seeds start popping, add the onions, chilli, tumeric and curry leaves and fry till it starts to get brown.
\\Once browned, add the coconut milk, and cook on medium with the lid off for for 15 minutes.  
\\Add the aubergine back in, and serve.

This dish can be served a bit runny, or quite dry. I prefer it pretty dry, and with the dahl completely broken down, which can be achieved by cooking it for an extra hour or so.

\smallskip
\emph{1 1/2 cups red lentils
\\1/2 tsp turmeric
\\1 tsp salt
\\2 small green chillies, finely diced

\smallskip
Fry onions in 3 tbsp ghee. 
\\When beginning to brown, add ginger and tomatoes, cooking till the tomatoes are reduced.
\\Add dahl and 5 cups water and bring to the boil, with turmeric, salt and green chillies.
\\Simmer for 50 minutes, stirring and adding water if it gets thick enough to burn.
\\As the lentils begin to dissolve, fry the seeds, garlic and the whole red chillies till is begins to brown. 
\\Combine the spices and the dahl, and serve.\sidenote{Add one tin coconut milk to Nana's dahl. Stir in spinach, serve with half boiled eggs and coriander on top}

\index{Meat curries!Lamb}

Nana's lamb/mutton marrow bone curry is one of my favourite dishes. In Sri Lanka mutton usually means goat, but lamb is often substituted in New Zealand. While this isn't Nana's recipe - it's still worth seeking out marrow bones for the curry.

Jaffna curry powder is dark roasted, and while optional, without it the curry has a very different taste.

\smallskip
\emph{3 tbsp ghee or butter
\\1 kg bone in lamb, diced
\\1 tin tomatoes
\\200ml stock
\\2 chillies, chopped
\\10 curry leaves, chopped
\\1 tbsp Jaffna curry powder (optional)
\\2 tbsp fennel, cinnamon, cumin, coriander, fenugreek, pepper, all ground, cardamon
\\5cm ginger
\\2 red onions, diced
\\10 cloves garlic
\\1 big bunch coriander}

\smallskip
Pre-heat oven to 170\celsius.
\\Put everything from the chillies, to the garlic in a food processor. Add half the coriander, then blend.
\\In an oven proof dish, fry the paste in the butter till it goes brown.
\\Add the tomatoes and the stock, cover in foil, and place in the oven for 1.5 hours.
\\Remove the foil and return to the stove.
\\Add the lamb, and cook for 1.5 hours, with the lid off for about half that time.

Similar to a chicken tikka masala, a Glaswegian curry, but without the sweetness or food colouring.

\smallskip
\newpart{For curry:}
\\\emph{4 skinless chicken thighs or breasts
\\2 onions
\\Thumb-sized piece of fresh ginger
\\1/2 bunch fresh coriander
\\1 fresh red chilli
\\1/2 tin of chopped tomatoes
\\400g tin coconut cream
\\Handful of flaked almonds, to serve
\\1 lemon, to serve}
\\\newpart{For spice paste:}
\\\emph{2 cloves of garlic
\\Thumb-sized piece of fresh ginger
\\1 teaspoon cumin seeds

\\2 tablespoons ground almonds}

\smallskip
To make the curry paste, halve, deseed and roughly chop the chillies, then peel the garlic and ginger. 
\\Put a frying pan over a medium-high heat and add the cumin and coriander seeds. Lightly toast for a few minutes, or until golden brown and smelling delicious, then remove from the heat. 
\\Add the toasted spices to a pestle and mortar and grind until fine, or put them in a food processor and whiz to a powder. 
\\Once you've ground them, add the toasted spices to a food processor along with the remaining paste ingredients and whiz to a smooth paste, then put to one side.
\\Slice the chicken lengthways into 2cm strips. 
\\On a clean chopping board, peel, halve and finely slice the onions. Peel and finely slice the ginger, then pick the coriander leaves and put to one side, finely chopping the stalks along with the chilli.
\\Place a large casserole pan over a medium-high heat and add a couple of lugs of oil. Once hot, add the onions, chilli, ginger and coriander stalks, then cook for around 10 minutes, or until softened and lightly golden. 
\\Add the chicken and roughly 140g of the tikka masala paste, stirring well so everything is nicely coated. Season with salt and pepper, add the tomatoes and coconut milk (save the rest for another day), then bring everything to the boil.
\\Turn the heat down to medium-low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes, then take the lid off and cook for further 5 minutes, or until the meat is tender and the sauce has reduced, stirring occasionally. 
\\Divide the curry between bowls, sprinkle over the almonds and coriander leaves. Serve with fluffy rice, a dollop of yoghurt and lemon wedges for squeezing over.

\\500g mascarpone (or instead: 250g sour cream and 250g soft cheese)
\\250g quark
\\vanilla essence

Mix mascarpone, quark, and vanilla.
\\Break meringue in pieces (not too small).
\\Fill mascarpone mix, raspberries and meringue in a bowl in layers.
