\chapter*{Introduction}

This cookbook is a collaborative work. The majority of the recipes come from Bill's recipe book, which he has collected over many years. Tina and I have added a few of our favourites, and tested out all the recipes in our own kitchen. While Tina took the majority of the photos in this book, you'll have to forgive the less artistic pictures as they were probably my contributions.

Plum cake is originally a Bavarian dish, known as Zwetschgendatschi. It's spread throughout Germany, where is it often known as Pflaumenkuchen (literally, "plum cake"). While in Cambridge, Tina and I have made use of the orchards a few miles away from Cambridge at her old college of Girton. In days after a trip to the orchard, our diet switches to mainly plum cake as we eat our way through kilograms and kilograms of the fruit.

\smallskip
\emph{2 sachets yeast (each sachet has 7g)
\\500g flour
\\220g sugar\sidenote{Tina usually uses only 120g}
\\250ml milk
\\100g butter
\\2kg plums
}

\smallskip
Mix lukewarm milk with sugar and yeast. Leave for 10 minutes until you see bubbles. 
\\Mix butter, flour and salt together. Then add the milk-sugar-yearst mix.
\\Knead well until dough doesn't stick to your hands anymore.
\\Let the dough rise (approx. 20 mins in the oven at about 35 degrees).
\\Then roll dough out on a square tray. Place plums on top. 
\\Let it rise again (approx. 20 mins in the oven at about 50 degrees).
\\Then bake for 25 mins at 175 degrees.\sidenote{If the plums are sour, you can also add some more sugar on top before baking).}

\index{Hummus!beetroot}

I love hummus. This beetroot hummus is a nice twist. If you are motivated to make it extra creamy, you can peel the chick peas. To do this either pinch each check pea one by one, or, to speed things up just put them in a bowl with water and rub the chick peas together. The second method won't get all the skins, but it only takes a few minutes. The hummus also tastes better after sitting overnight in the fridge.

\begin{marginfigure}%
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{beetroothummus.png}
\end{marginfigure}

\smallskip
\emph{4 tbsp olive oil
\\1 tin chick peas
\\2 tablespoons tahini
\\2 cloves garlic
\\Large sprinkle toasted cumin seeds
\\4 small cooked beetroot\sidenote{
You can replace with almost anything! My favourite is half a block feta and 4 dates, roughly chopped.}
\\Salt and pepper to taste.
}

\smallskip
Put everything in a food processor.
\\Blitz it, adding water to get the looseness you want. 
\\Serve with sumac and cumin sprinkled on top.

A cheats Dosa. While it lacks the fermented taste and super crispy edges of real Dosa, this recipe is a super easy approximation of that South Indian dish. The potato filling and the batter are best made a bit ahead of time.

\begin{marginfigure}%
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{masalapancakes.png}
\end{marginfigure}

\smallskip
\emph{Olive oil, for frying
\\1 green chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
\\2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced
\\3cm piece of fresh root ginger, peeled and finely chopped
\\125g plain flour
\\1 large egg
\\275ml whole milk
\\1 tsp mustard seeds
\\1/2 onion, peeled and thinly sliced
\\1 tsp ground turmeric
\\4 to 6 cold, peeled boiled potatoes, roughly chopped
\\6 tbsp natural yoghurt
\\2 tbsp chopped coriander}

\smallskip
\newpart{For the potato filling:} 
\\Heat a little oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, add the mustard seeds and cook for 2 minutes until the seeds begin to pop. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until soft and golden brown. Stir in the turmeric and cooked potatoes and season, adding a dash of olive oil if necessary to aid frying. Fry over a medium heat for 4 minutes until softened and heated through. Leave to one side while you cook the pancakes.
\\\newpart{For the pancakes:} 
\\Toast the cumin seeds with a pinch of salt in a dry, medium- hot pan for about 1 minute until aromatic. Add a dash of oil and saute the chilli, garlic and ginger for a further 2 minutes until softened. Remove from the heat.
\\Put the spice/garlic mix into a bowl. Sift in the flour, season and make a well in the middle, then break in the egg and add half of the milk. Whisk the flour into the egg slowly until well incorporated, then gradually add the remaining milk. Continue whisking until the mixture is smooth and has the consistency of double cream. Whisk in 1 teaspoon of oil, then taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Leave the batter to rest for 10 minutes.
\\Heat a large, wide frying pan, then add a little oil. If the batter has thickened too much, add a tablespoon or two of milk. Pour in a ladleful of batter and tilt the pan to spread the batter out. Cook for a minute on one side until golden and crisp, then flip the pancake and continue to cook for a further minute until cooked through. Keep warm while repeating with the remaining batter.
\\\newpart{To serve:} 
\\Mix the yoghurt and coriander together and season to taste.
\\To serve, place a large spoonful of the potato filling in the middle of each pancake, adding a dollop of the yoghurt if you like, then roll up into a sausage shape.

\section{Roast pork belly with apple and sweet potato mash}
\index{Mains!Roast pork belly}
\index{Roast!Pork belly}

This dish takes about three days - but it's actually a really easy, and impressive, main to make. This recipe is a slightly modified version of one by Peter Gordon (a kiwi chef). The pork is first marinated, then cooked. It can be served immediately after the first roasting, but if you're cooking it for a dinner party, it can be cooled, portioned into perfect rectangles, then reheated on the day.

\smallskip
\emph{2 kg boneless pork belly
\\50g (5 tbsp) five-spice
\\5 large carrots
\\3 granny-smith apples, peeled and diced
\\700g potatoes, peeled and diced
\\700g sweet potato, peeled and diced
\\50g butter
\\4 tbsp grain mustard
\\2 limes
\\3 tbsp capers, drained and chopped
\\Big bunch of coriander, chopped
}

\smallskip
Score the rind and fat about 1cm apart, being careful to not cut all the way down into the meat. 
\\Mix the five-spice with an equal amount of salt and rub into the pork. Then place the pork in a tupperware so it's just submerged in water and leave for 24-48 hours in the fridge.
\\After the brining has finished, heat the oven to 190\celsius. Place a sheet of baking paper on a rimmed tray, and place the carrots, cut in half long-ways, on top. 
\\Place the pork on top of the carrots, skin side up. Pour 200ml of water on the tray, and roast the pork and carrots for 2 hours. 
\\After two hours, remove the pork and place in the fridge. Keep the fat and carrots as well. At this stage the pork can be kept for up to 4 days.
\\On the day you plan to eat, turn the oven to 190\celsius. 
\\To make the coriander mustard, simply mix lime juice, mustard, capers and coriander. Add a little oil if you want it smoother. 
\\To make the mash, take the fat and and add to a pan with the butter. When the butter starts to brown, add in the apples and carrots and cook with the lid on low till the apple turns to mush. 
\\While the apple cooks, boil the diced potato and sweet potatoes. Once the potatoes are ready, add the apple and mash. This mash can be made a bit early, and reheated when needed. 
\\About 40 minutes before you want to eat, fry the portioned belly pork in a pan with oil till the skin get's bubbly. Then flip the pork over, and put in the oven for 30 minutes.

\section{Black pudding, pea, peanut, mushroom and spinach ragout}
\index{Mains!black pudding ragout}

This dish is a Scottish-Chinese hybrid, but it really works. The recipe comes from Peter Gordon at The Providores - a highly rated Kiwi restaurant in London.

\smallskip
\emph{200g black pudding
\\Peanut oil
\\Sesame oil
\\1 onion, peeled and thinly sliced
\\Big handful shitake mushrooms
\\Half thumb of ginger, julienned
\\50 ml mirin or 25ml rice wine vinegar
\\50 ml soy sauce
\\60 peanuts
\\100g spinach
\\100g peas
\\400g fresh rice noodles
}

\smallskip
Add the black pudding to a cold pan, and heat to medium high. Add a little oil if the black pudding isn't fatty. 
\\Once the black pudding is starting to go crispy, remove from the pan and add the oil, mushrooms and ginger.
\\When the onions have browned, add in the soy sauce and mirin (or rice wine vinegar) and cook till the pan goes dry.
\\Then add the peanuts, spinach and peas with a heavy splash of water.
\\Heat the noodles in the microwave by pouring on some water and covering with cling film.
\\To serve, add a little water if the ragout is dry, and place on the heated noodles.

\section{Anchovy and breadcrumb pasta }
\index{Mains!Pasta}
\index{Pasta!Anchovy and breadcrumb}

A great store cupboard recipe - if you have bread, you probably have all the ingredients needed. With good quality olive oil it's an amazing dinner.

\smallskip
\emph{Spaghetti or linguine for three
\\1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed
\\12 anchovies, chopped
\\6 garlic cloves, minced
\\1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
\\1 cup good dried bread crumbs
\\2 egg yolks
\\1 tablespoon Asian fish sauce (optional)
\\1 teaspoon hot sauce, such as Tabasco, or to taste
\\1/2 cup roughly chopped parsley
\\ Peas, asparagus, or any quick cooking vegetable (optional)
\\Lemon wedges, for serving}

\smallskip
In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, warm oil. Add anchovies, garlic and red pepper flakes; cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Stir in bread crumbs and cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Season liberally with black pepper, and a little salt if needed.
\\Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook according to package instructions; drain well, reserving some of the pasta water (about 1/2 cup is plenty). If vegetables are being added, chuck them into the pasta a few minutes before the end.
\\In a large, preferably warmed bowl, stir together egg yolks, fish sauce, hot sauce and 2 tablespoons pasta water. Add hot pasta and toss well, adding more pasta water if the mixture looks dry or unevenly yellow. You want the yolk to evenly coat the pasta but you don't want it to be soupy. Add bread crumb mixture and parsley and toss well. Season with plenty of black pepper, and salt to taste. Drizzle pasta with more oil just before serving and serve with lemon wedges.

\index{Noodles!Phat thai}

Phat thai and I have a weird relationship. Like how hollandaise becomes less appealing when you make it yourself (and see all the butter) - I can't seem to make good phat thai without a lot of oil. It's still a great, and easy dish to make - it just needs a lot of ingredients.

\smallskip
\emph{120g 2-3mm wide flat rice sticks
\\60ml fish sauce
\\60ml tamarind water
\\60g palm sugar
\\Pinch of chilli powder, to taste
\\80ml groundnut or vegetable oil
\\2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
\\100g extra-firm tofu, chopped into small cubes
\\8 large prawns
\\2 large eggs, ready cracked
\\1 tbsp small dried shrimp
\\100g beansprouts
\\4 stalks Chinese chives, chopped
\\50g roasted peanuts, roughly chopped
\\Lime wedges, chilli flakes, fish sauce and sugar, to garnish}

\smallskip
Soak the rice sticks in cold water for about half an hour until pliable but al dente. Drain.
\\Meanwhile, make the sauce by combining the fish sauce, tamarind and palm sugar in a small pan. Heat gently to dissolve the sugar and taste. Add more of any of the ingredients as you wish. Season with chilli to taste. Set aside.
\\Lay out all the ingredients within easy reach of the hob in the order they'll be used. Put a wok on a high heat and add half the oil. Add the garlic, stir fry for a few seconds, then add the noodles and a splash of water. Stir fry until they're drying out, then add the sauce. Fry until they are almost soft enough to eat (they should be slightly chewy).
\\Push the noodles to the side of the wok and add the rest of the oil. Fry the tofu and prawns until the tofu is beginning to colour, then push to the side and add the eggs. Pierce the yolks and, when starting to set on the bottom, scramble.
\\Stir through the noodles, and add the radish, dried shrimp, beansprouts, chives and peanuts. Stir fry until well combined, then serve with the garnishes for people to add as they wish.

Nana was known for creating the three greatest dishes in the culinary world (marrow bone mutton curry, Nana's rolls \& Nana's brinjol). The original eggplant dish required the vegetable to be fried. If you fry - the dish will be incredible, but it will soak up at least 250mls of oil. Hence the slightly more waistline friendly recipe below.

\smallskip
\emph{3-4 Brinjal (eggplant)
\\1 tbsp mustard seeds
\\a few heavy splashes of oil
\\3 onions, diced or sliced
\\1 tsp salt
\\1 chillies, finely diced
\\2 tsp tumeric
\\1 stem curry leaves
\\1 tin coconut milk}

\smallskip
Preheat the oven to 200\celsius 
\\Dice the brinjal and pour over the oil. Tip into an overproof tray and cook for 40 minutes, or till brown.
\\In a fry pan, fry the mustard seeds in a little oil.
\\Once the seeds start popping, add the onions, chilli, tumeric and curry leaves and fry till it starts to get brown.
\\Once browned, add the coconut milk, and cook on medium with the lid off for for 15 minutes.  
\\Add the aubergine back in, and serve.

Nana's lamb/mutton marrow bone curry is one of my favourite dishes. In Sri Lanka mutton usually means goat, but lamb is often substituted in New Zealand. While this isn't Nana's recipe - it's still worth seeking out marrow bones for the curry.

Jaffna curry powder is dark roasted, and while optional, without it the curry has a very different taste.

\smallskip
\emph{3 tbsp ghee or butter
\\1 kg bone in lamb, diced
\\1 tin tomatoes
\\200ml stock
\\2 chillies, chopped
\\10 curry leaves, chopped
\\1 tbsp Jaffna curry powder (optional)
\\2 tbsp fennel, cinnamon, cumin, coriander, fenugreek, pepper, all ground, cardamon
\\5cm ginger
\\2 red onions, diced
\\10 cloves garlic
\\1 big bunch coriander}

\smallskip
Pre-heat oven to 170\celsius.
\\Put everything from the chillies, to the garlic in a food processor. Add half the coriander, then blend.
\\In an oven proof dish, fry the paste in the butter till it goes brown.
\\Add the tomatoes and the stock, cover in foil, and place in the oven for 1.5 hours.

\\2 tablespoons ground almonds}

\smallskip
To make the curry paste, halve, deseed and roughly chop the chillies, then peel the garlic and ginger. 
\\Put a frying pan over a medium-high heat and add the cumin and coriander seeds. Lightly toast for a few minutes, or until golden brown and smelling delicious, then remove from the heat. 
\\Add the toasted spices to a pestle and mortar and grind until fine, or put them in a food processor and whiz to a powder. 
\\Once you've ground them, add the toasted spices to a food processor along with the remaining paste ingredients and whiz to a smooth paste, then put to one side.
\\Slice the chicken lengthways into 2cm strips. 
\\On a clean chopping board, peel, halve and finely slice the onions. Peel and finely slice the ginger, then pick the coriander leaves and put to one side, finely chopping the stalks along with the chilli.
\\Place a large casserole pan over a medium-high heat and add a couple of lugs of oil. Once hot, add the onions, chilli, ginger and coriander stalks, then cook for around 10 minutes, or until softened and lightly golden. 
\\Add the chicken and roughly 140g of the tikka masala paste, stirring well so everything is nicely coated. Season with salt and pepper, add the tomatoes and coconut milk (save the rest for another day), then bring everything to the boil.
\\Turn the heat down to medium-low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes, then take the lid off and cook for further 5 minutes, or until the meat is tender and the sauce has reduced, stirring occasionally. 
\\Divide the curry between bowls, sprinkle over the almonds and coriander leaves. Serve with fluffy rice, a dollop of yoghurt and lemon wedges for squeezing over.
