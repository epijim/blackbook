Not the usual brunch fare, but this colonial throwback can also make an easy dinner. Recipe serves two.

\begin{marginfigure}%
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{kedgeree.png}
\end{marginfigure}

\smallskip
\newpart{For rice:}
\\\emph{120g rice
\\600ml stock
\\2 eggs
\\1 onion sliced
\\3 cloves garlic
\\1 tbsp English curry powder
\\1 tsp tumeric
\\5 curry leaves or 3 bay leaves
\\2 fillets smoked fish\sidenote{
In the photo we also added some cooked seafood right before serving.}
\\1 chilli
\\1 tbsp butter
\\1 lemon sliced into quarters
}
\\\newpart{For yoghurt:}
\\\emph{Big handful coriander finely cut
\\1/2 cup yoghurt
\\Rind of 1 lemon
}
\smallskip
\\Get 600ml of stock to the boil, then add the eggs and set the timer to soft boiled (take eggs out of the stock when they are cooked).
\\In another pan, fry the onion with the curry powder, tumeric and a little oil. After a few minutes, add the garlic.
\\Once the onion is starting to brown, add the rice and stir. As soon as it's mixed, add in the stock. 
\\Keep the rice on medium high and occasionally stir. You might need to add a little water.
\\Once the rice is cooked, add in the seafood and butter. Season after tasting, as the fish might be salty. Serve with lemon wedges and sprinkle coriander on as garnish.
\\Mix the yoghurt, rind and coriander. Serve with rice.

\section{Beetroot hummus}
\index{Starters!beetroot hummus}
\index{Hummus!beetroot}

I love hummus. This beetroot hummus is a nice twist. If you are motivated to make it extra creamy, you can peel the chick peas. To do this either pinch each check pea one by one, or, to speed things up just put them in a bowl with water and rub the chick peas together. The second method won't get all the skins. It also tastes better after sitting overnight in the fridge.

\begin{marginfigure}%
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{beetroothummus.png}
\end{marginfigure}

\smallskip
\emph{4 tbsp olive oil
\\1 tin chick peas
\\2 tablespoons tahini
\\2 cloves garlic
\\Large sprinkle toasted cumin seeds
\\4 small cooked beetroot\sidenote{
You can replace with almost anything! My favourite is half a block feta and 4 dates, roughly chopped.}
\\Salt and pepper to taste.
}

\smallskip
Put everything in a food processor.
\\Blitz it, adding water to get the looseness you want. 
\\Serve with sumac and cumin sprinkled on top.

A Roquefort salad, without having to have the roquefort. In Cambridge, Shopshire Blue (which is an orange cheese with blue veins) makes a great substitution.

\smallskip
\emph{3 rinsed pears, cut into chunks
\\200g baby spinach
\\1/2 cup blue cheese\sidenote{
I also really like this salad with a strong goats cheese.}
\\1/2 cup toasted walnuts
\\Lemon juice
\\4 tbsp olive oil
\\1/2 tsp honey
\\1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
\\Parmesan shavings
}

\smallskip
Splash the cut pears with lemon juice to prevent them browning.
\\Whisk together the olive oil, balsamic vinegar and honey to make a vinaigrette.
\\Season the vinaigrette, remembering to underseason if the cheese is salty.
\\Fold together all the ingredients except the parmesan and walnuts, which get scattered on when serving.

\section{Anchovy and breadcrumb pasta }
\index{Mains!Pasta}
\index{Pasta!Anchovy and breadcrumb}

I great store cupboard recipe - if you have bread, you probably have all the ingredients needed. With good quality olive oil it's an amazing dinner.

\smallskip
\emph{Spaghetti or linguine for three
\\1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed
\\12 anchovies, chopped
\\6 garlic cloves, minced
\\1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
\\1 cup good dried bread crumbs
\\2 egg yolks
\\1 tablespoon Asian fish sauce (optional)
\\1 teaspoon hot sauce, such as Tabasco, or to taste
\\1/2 cup roughly chopped parsley
\\ Peas, asparagus, or any quick cooking vegetable (optional)
\\Lemon wedges, for serving}

\smallskip
In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, warm oil. Add anchovies, garlic and red pepper flakes; cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Stir in bread crumbs and cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Season liberally with black pepper, and a little salt if needed.
\\Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook according to package instructions; drain well, reserving some of the pasta water (about 1/2 cup is plenty). If vegetables are being added, chuck them into the pasta a few minutes before the end.
\\In a large, preferably warmed bowl, stir together egg yolks, fish sauce, hot sauce and 2 tablespoons pasta water. Add hot pasta and toss well, adding more pasta water if the mixture looks dry or unevenly yellow. You want the yolk to evenly coat the pasta but you don't want it to be soupy. Add bread crumb mixture and parsley and toss well. Season with plenty of black pepper, and salt to taste. Drizzle pasta with more oil just before serving and serve with lemon wedges.

\section{Phat thai}
\index{Mains!Phat thai}
\index{Noodles!Phat thai}

Phat thai and I have a weird relationship. Like how hollandaise becomes less appealing when you make it yourself (and see all the butter) - I can't seem to make good phat thai without a lot of oil. It's still a great, and easy dish to make - it just needs a lot of ingredients.

\smallskip
\emph{120g 2-3mm wide flat rice sticks
\\60ml fish sauce
\\60ml tamarind water
\\60g palm sugar
\\Pinch of chilli powder, to taste
\\80ml groundnut or vegetable oil
\\2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
\\100g extra-firm tofu, chopped into small cubes
\\8 large prawns
\\2 large eggs, ready cracked
\\1 tbsp small dried shrimp
\\100g beansprouts
\\4 stalks Chinese chives, chopped
\\50g roasted peanuts, roughly chopped
\\Lime wedges, chilli flakes, fish sauce and sugar, to garnish}

\smallskip
Soak the rice sticks in cold water for about half an hour until pliable but al dente. Drain.
\\Meanwhile, make the sauce by combining the fish sauce, tamarind and palm sugar in a small pan. Heat gently to dissolve the sugar and taste. Add more of any of the ingredients as you wish. Season with chilli to taste. Set aside.
\\Lay out all the ingredients within easy reach of the hob in the order they'll be used. Put a wok on a high heat and add half the oil. Add the garlic, stir fry for a few seconds, then add the noodles and a splash of water. Stir fry until they're drying out, then add the sauce. Fry until they are almost soft enough to eat (they should be slightly chewy).
\\Push the noodles to the side of the wok and add the rest of the oil. Fry the tofu and prawns until the tofu is beginning to colour, then push to the side and add the eggs. Pierce the yolks and, when starting to set on the bottom, scramble.
\\Stir through the noodles, and add the radish, dried shrimp, beansprouts, chives and peanuts. Stir fry until well combined, then serve with the garnishes for people to add as they wish.

An easy dinner party dish as you can make it 90\% before hand, then just add the shellfish and reheat to serve.

\smallskip
\emph{250g tomatoes, with x in top\sidenote{Or half a tin of tomatoes}
\\100ml olive oil
\\6 chicken thighs\sidenote{You can easily omit either the chicken or prawns}

\\1 red pepper, finely chopped
\\2 cloves garlic
\\1 1/2 tsp sweet paprika
\\1/2 tsp cayanne pepper
\\Large pinch of saffron
\\350g paella rice
\\1.2L stock

\\3 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsely leaves
\\Finely chopped zest and juice of one lemon
}

\begin{marginfigure}%

\smallskip
Boil the tomatoes for 10 seconds then skin and deseed.
\\Heat the oil in a large frying pan to medium and fry the chicken skin side down till dark brown with the chorizo.
\\Remove the chicken and add chorizo.\sidenote{I like to blend 1/3 of the chorizo so it melts into the paella, but that's completely optional and probably heresy.}
\\Soon after, add the peppers and garlic and fry for 3 minutes.
\\Add the spices and rice.
\\After a few minutes, once the rice starts to go clear, add the stock and tomatoes and bring to the boil.\sidenote{If you deheaded the shrimp, I like to add it to the stock while it's heating (discard before adding to the paella).}
\\Turn the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes with the lid off.
\\Then add back the chicken, with the prawns and peas, and cook for 15 more minutes.\sidenote{If the prawns are large, turn them once by hand to make sure they cook through.}
\\Squeeze over a lemon and sprinkle with zest and juice.

As a true new zealander we have an electric pie maker (it was a gift). The only creation it has brought into the world has been pork pies. A recipe for mince pies is in the works.

\smallskip
\emph{400g diced pork
\\2 tbsp flour
\\2 tbsp oil
\\1 onion, diced finely
\\4 apples, peeled and chopped
\\2 cloves garlic
\\2 cups apple juice or cider

\\Shortcrust pastry packet
\\4 tbsp milk}

\smallskip
Toss pork in flour and fry until lightly brown, then put aside.
\\Fry onion, garlic and apple for 3 minutes.
\\Add apple juice or cider to deglaze, then add the prunes.
\\Cook on low for about an hour, then let it cool off the heat.
\\When cold (or at least cool-ish), make pie and glaze pastry with milk.

\\Add lamb back in, cover and simmer for an hour.
\\Remove lid, add lemon rind, honey, cinnamon, and fruit and simmer for 30mins with the lid off.\sidenote{

Super simple, light and refreshing. Letting it sit in the fridge softens the coconut a lot, and changes the dish substantially. It's best to season just before eating to keep the carrots firmer.

\section{Nana's brinjal}

\index{Vegetarian curries!Nana's brinjal}

Nana was known for creating the three greatest dishes in the culinary world (marrow bone mutton curry, Nana's rolls \& Nana's brinjol). The original eggplant dish required the vegetable to be fried. If you fry - the dish will be incredible, but it will soak up at least 250mls of oil. Hence the slightly more waistline friendly recipe below.

\smallskip
\emph{3-4 Brinjal (eggplant)
\\1 tbsp mustard seeds
\\a few heavy splashes of oil
\\3 onions, diced or sliced
\\1 tsp salt
\\1 chillies, finely diced
\\2 tsp tumeric
\\1 stem curry leaves
\\1 tin coconut milk}

\smallskip
Preheat the oven to 200\celsius 
\\Dice the brinjal and pour over the oil. Tip into an overproof tray and cook for 40 minutes, or till brown.
\\In a fry pan, fry the mustard seeds in a little oil.
\\Once the seeds start popping, add the onions, chilli, tumeric and curry leaves and fry till it starts to get brown.
\\Once browned, add the coconut milk, and cook on medium with the lid off for for 15 minutes.  
\\Add the aubergine back in, and serve.

\section{Nana's dahl}
\index{Nana's!dahl}
\index{Vegetarian curries!Nana's dahl}

This dish can be served a bit runny, or quite dry. I prefer it pretty dry, and with the dahl completely broken down, which can be achieved by cooking it for an extra hour or so.

\smallskip
\emph{1 1/2 cups red lentils
\\1/2 tsp turmeric
\\1 tsp salt
\\2 small green chillies, finely diced
\\5 tbsp ghee or butter
\\2 medium onions, finely chopped
\\1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated
\\2 large finely chopped tomatoes
\\1 tsp mustard seeds
\\1 tsp fennel seeds
\\1 tsp nigella seeds
\\1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds
\\4 curry leaves
\\2 small red chillies
\\2 cloves garlic, chopped}

\smallskip
Fry onions in 3 tbsp ghee. 
\\When beginning to brown, add ginger and tomatoes, cooking till the tomatoes are reduced.
\\Add dahl and 5 cups water and bring to the boil, with turmeric, salt and green chillies.
\\Simmer for 50 minutes, stirring and adding water if it gets thick enough to burn.
\\As the lentils begin to dissolve, fry the seeds, garlic and the whole red chillies till is begins to brown. 
\\Combine the spices and the dahl, and serve.\sidenote{Add one tin coconut milk to Nana's dahl. Stir in spinach, serve with half boiled eggs and coriander on top}

A relatively easy curry. I like it with the skin removed, although you could try browning the chicken to make the skin more appealing.

\\2 tbsp Jaffna curry powder
\\1 tsp cinnamon, cloves, cardamon and salt

\section{Lamb curry}

\index{Meat curries!Lamb}

Nana's lamb/mutton marrow bone curry is one of the three greatest dishes. In Sri Lanka, mutton usually means goat, but lamb is often substituted in New Zealand. While this isn't Nana's recipe - it's still worth seeking out marrow bones for the curry.

Jaffna curry powder is dark roasted, and while optional, without it the curry has a very different taste.

\smallskip
\emph{3 tbsp ghee or butter
\\1 kg bone in lamb, diced
\\1 tin tomatoes
\\200ml stock
\\2 chillies, chopped
\\10 curry leaves, chopped
\\1 tbsp Jaffna curry powder (optional)
\\2 tbsp fennel, cinnamon, cumin, coriander, fenugreek, pepper, all ground, cardamon
\\5cm ginger
\\2 red onions, diced
\\10 cloves garlic
\\1 big bunch coriander}

\smallskip
Pre-heat oven to 170\celsius.
\\Put everything from the chillies, to the garlic in a food processor. Add half the coriander, then blend.
\\In an oven proof dish, fry the paste in the butter till it goes brown.
\\Add the tomatoes and the stock, cover in foil, and place in the oven for 1.5 hours.
\\Remove the foil and return to the stove.
\\Add the lamb, and cook for 1.5 hours, with the lid off for about half that time.

Similar to a chicken tikka masala, a Glaswegian curry, but without the sweetness or food colouring.

\smallskip
\newpart{For curry:}
\\\emph{4 skinless chicken thighs or breasts
\\2 onions
\\Thumb-sized piece of fresh ginger
\\1/2 bunch fresh coriander
\\1 fresh red chilli
\\1/2 tin of chopped tomatoes
\\400g tin coconut cream
\\Handful of flaked almonds, to serve
\\1 lemon, to serve}
\\\newpart{For spice paste:}
\\\emph{2 cloves of garlic
\\Thumb-sized piece of fresh ginger
\\1 teaspoon cumin seeds

\\2 teaspoons garam masala
\\1/2 teaspoon sea salt
\\2 tablespoons groundnut oil
\\2 tablespoons tomato puree
\\Small bunch of fresh coriander

\\2 tablespoons ground almonds}

\smallskip
To make the curry paste, halve, deseed and roughly chop the chillies, then peel the garlic and ginger. 
\\Put a frying pan over a medium-high heat and add the cumin and coriander seeds. Lightly toast for a few minutes, or until golden brown and smelling delicious, then remove from the heat. 
\\Add the toasted spices to a pestle and mortar and grind until fine, or put them in a food processor and whiz to a powder. 
\\Once you've ground them, add the toasted spices to a food processor along with the remaining paste ingredients and whiz to a smooth paste, then put to one side.
\\Slice the chicken lengthways into 2cm strips. 
\\On a clean chopping board, peel, halve and finely slice the onions. Peel and finely slice the ginger, then pick the coriander leaves and put to one side, finely chopping the stalks along with the chilli.
\\Place a large casserole pan over a medium-high heat and add a couple of lugs of oil. Once hot, add the onions, chilli, ginger and coriander stalks, then cook for around 10 minutes, or until softened and lightly golden. 
\\Add the chicken and roughly 140g of the tikka masala paste, stirring well so everything is nicely coated. Season with salt and pepper, add the tomatoes and coconut milk (save the rest for another day), then bring everything to the boil.
\\Turn the heat down to medium-low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes, then take the lid off and cook for further 5 minutes, or until the meat is tender and the sauce has reduced, stirring occasionally. 
\\Divide the curry between bowls, sprinkle over the almonds and coriander leaves. Serve with fluffy rice, a dollop of yoghurt and lemon wedges for squeezing over.

\\500g mascarpone (or instead: 250g sour cream and 250g soft cheese)
\\250g quark

\smallskip
Mix mascarpone, quark, and vanilla.

\\Fill mascarpone mix, raspberries and meringue in a bowl in layers.
\\Leave for 3-4 hours in the fridge.
